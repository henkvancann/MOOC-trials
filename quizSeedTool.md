## As a creator sender of shares. Select the most appropriate answer

### What does M of N sharding mean?
- A. N pieces out of M pieces in total of a puzzle together will be enough to recreate a master private key
- B. N pieces out of M pieces in total of a puzzle together will be enough to recreate a seed
- C. M pieces out of N pieces in total of a puzzle together will be enough to recreate a master private key
- D. M pieces out of N pieces in total of a puzzle together will be enough to recreate a seed

Answer D is the best. Although answer C. Is indirectly possible, because the master private key can be derived from the seed. However the SeedTool itself does not provide this feature.

### A good way to shard your master private key’s seed with SeedTool is to print the Shard sheet and:
- A. Copy the sheet as many times as you need to distribute over family and friends, because a few of them might lose track of where they put it. Distribute right away.
- B. Store the sheet in a safe place, keep coupons carefully together to be used once you need them.
- C. Cut individual shard coupons and store them in separate safe places.
- D. Keep one sheet as a back-up in a safe place and cut and distribute individual shard coupons among designated friends and family.

Answer C. Is the correct answer. Answer A is dreadful, you might well lose your funds. To a lesser extent B and D are also security risk for your funds, because the whole idea of shares, is that the individual are not kept together at all.
