Key management is key to asset security. We'd like the people in the world to self-educate themselves on their smartphone.

## Input docs

### HackMD.io with the idea
[KERI-MOOC](https://hackmd.io/nuUu5S8UQjOHXw_a53LvvA) This was the original idea. We are now taking a few steps back and first get a basic Moodle quiz going with on-topic content.

### Questions SeedTool - Blockchain Commons
[Trial questions SeedTool](https://github.com/henkvancann/MOOC-trials/blob/master/quizSeedTool.md)

## Objective
I would like to start this project among Jasmina, Kor and myself. My idea: Kor turns a few sample questions into a quiz that also works on a smart phone and Jasmina can then try to reverse engineer this prototype in Moodle.

For text in Markdown we could use HackMD.io, for this keep its version also in sync using Github.

The reason why I propose these tools is that in the end we work for the KERI MOOC, and they cling to the formats and procedures of IETF, which is a world-wide web standards body and Trust over IP Foundation, that focusses on a self-sovereign identifiers technical / governance model.

Kor can assist Jasmina by helping to set up the hosting environment for the Moodle install with our serviceprovider Digistate.nl.
