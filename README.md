# MOOC-trials
Key management is key to asset security. We'd like the people in the world to self-educate themselves on their smartphone.

## Input docs

### HackMD.io with the idea
[KERI-MOOC](https://hackmd.io/nuUu5S8UQjOHXw_a53LvvA) This was the original idea. We are now taking a few steps back and first get a basic Moodle quiz going with on-topic content.

### Questions SeedTool - Blockchain Commons
[Trial questions SeedTool](https://github.com/henkvancann/MOOC-trials/blob/master/quizSeedTool.md)

These example questions are not easy questions. An exam like this, or test of you wish, is somewhere far down the road of a student that has already passed many tests before. It's kind of contradictory but the first questionaires, the one students will be confronted with the earliest, are the most delicate to create. The easiest part for us, is the creation of complex on-topic questions, that students will have to study and pass further down the road.

Why are the easiest exams to pass the most delicate? Because 98% of the MOOC students will only see the first three lessons and exams. The abortion rate will be high. 
So therefore we'll stick to **complex** questions at the beginning, for they are low-hanging fruit for us and more matching with the language of crypto-key management experts.

#### SeedTool (BCC) and Keep (KERI)
SeedTool adds key management functionality to what Keep in KERI currently (March 2022) offers. The sample questions created from the SeedTool experience therefore are also a way to explore the possibilties of a combination of the two tools.

## Objective
I would like to start this project among Jasmina, Kor and myself. My idea: 

Kor has already turned a few sample questions into a quiz that also works on a smart phone:

Jasmina can then try to make this prototype in Moodle or as close as possible.

For text in Markdown we could use HackMD.io, for this keep its version also in sync using Github.

The reason why I propose these tools is that in the end we work for the KERI MOOC, and they cling to the formats and procedures of IETF, which is a world-wide web standards body and Trust over IP Foundation, that focusses on a self-sovereign identifiers technical / governance model.

Kor can assist Jasmina by helping to set up the hosting environment for the Moodle install with our serviceprovider Digistate.nl.
